## Code
The code for this project is written in C++. It is provided in a .ino file, which can be opened in the arduino IDE. Just download the relevant libraries and it should work right out of the box.

If you would like to use a different IDE (like PlatformIO in VSCode for instance) you will just need to add:
```
#include <Arduino.h>
```
at the top of the file.
